User: "A lone surfer at sunset"
Answer: "A silhouetted lone surfer riding a massive wave at golden hour, captured with a telephoto lens (200mm) at f/2.8. The ocean spray creates a misty halo around the surfer, backlit by the warm, orange sun setting on the horizon. The composition places the surfer in the bottom right third of the frame, with the curve of the wave leading the eye across the image. The color palette emphasizes deep blues of the ocean transitioning to vibrant oranges and purples in the sky. Incorporate subtle lens flare to enhance the dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. Style: Cinematic beach photography with high contrast and rich colors."
